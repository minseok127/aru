/*
 * This file implements an grace-period mechanism for managing a pointer.
 * The design packs an outer reference count and a version pointer into 
 * a single 64-bit control block stored in the atomsnap_gate structure, 
 * while the version itself (atomsnap_version) maintains an inner 
 * reference count.
 *
 * The 8-byte control block in atomsnap_gate is structured as follows:
 *   - Upper 16 bits: outer reference counter.
 *   - Lower 48 bits: pointer of the current version.
 *
 * Writers have their own version and each version can be concurrently read by
 * multiple readers. If a writer simply deallocates an old version to
 * replace it, readers might access wrong memory. To avoid this, multiple
 * versions are maintained.
 * 
 * When a reader wants to access the current version, it atomically increments
 * the outer reference counter using fetch_add(). The returned 64-bit value has
 * its lower 48-bits representing the pointer of the version whose reference
 * count was increased.
 *
 * After finishing the use of the version, the reader must release it. During release,
 * the reader increments the inner reference counter by 1. If the resulting inner
 * counter is 0, it indicates that no other threads are referencing that
 * version, so it can be freed.
 *
 * In the version replacement process, the writer atomically exchanges the 8-byte
 * control block with a new one (using atomic instruction), and the old control block,
 * which contains the previous version's outer reference count and version pointer, 
 * is returned. Because this update is atomic, new readers cannot access the old
 * version anymore. The writer then decrements the old version's inner counter by the
 * old outer reference count.
 *
 * Consequently, if a reader's release operation makes the inner counter to reach 0,
 * this reader is the last user of that version. If the writer's release operation
 * makes the inner counter to reach 0, this writer is the last user of that version.
 * Then the last user (reader or writer) can free the old version.
 *
 * cf) Why we divide the reference counter into two?
 * Because it is only possible to increment the reference counter in an 8-byte 
 * control block, but it is not possible to decrement. The reader wants to decrease
 * the reference count at the end. But the writer may changed the control block 
 * to the other version, so the reader can't use it. So, the reader must notice 
 * to the other reference counter, inner counter.
